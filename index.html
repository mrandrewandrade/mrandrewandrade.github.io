<h2>Andrew Andrade</h2>
<h3>Learner/Teacher * @<a href="https://portcredit.peelschools.org/"target="_blank">Port Credit Secondary School</a></h3>
<p>
* In teacher's college I learnt from <a href="https://dam-oclc.bac-lac.gc.ca/download?is_thesis=1&oclc_number=1356862821&id=7f8e0732-6c05-45b4-ba9f-fa39b2d3dfe4&fileName=cormier_paul.pdf"target="_blank"> Prof. Cormier's thesis </a>a> the Ojibwe phrase: 
  "Kinoo’amaadawaad" or ‘learning with each other’ which can also be translated as ‘teaching with each other’. I share the same view that learning and teaching have the same meaning!  I am as much as a learner as the students are my teachers.

The simplicity of the site is intentional: it loads blazingly fast, it is fully reponsive and it looks beautiful on all web browers.<br>
If you are looking for eye candy, my <a href="https://andrewandrade.ca/cv/"target="_blank">curricula vit&aelig;</a> or <a href="http://andrewandrade.ca/blog"target="_blank">blog</a> are more flashy and almost as beautiful as this static page.<br>
